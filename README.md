# Quiz App
A quiz app that determines whether you're sober enough to send a text.  This app was created as part of the week 9 practice project of Makers Academy.  The goal in mind was an app that would present the user with a quiz and then have it declare their level of inebriation after tallying up their final score.  The project was built using React-Native and was tested using a combination of Jest and Enzyme.
